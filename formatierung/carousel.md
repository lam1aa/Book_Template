# Carousels

## Overview
A carousel is a slideshow component for cycling through images, text, or other content. It's a common feature in modern web design and can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Implementation
Basic carousel elements include:
- Slides container
- Individual slides
- Navigation arrows
- Indicator dots (optional)

## Best Practices
- Keep load time minimal
- Ensure accessibility
- Provide user controls
- Limit number of slides
- Auto-pause on hover

## Code Example

## sphinx


````{card-carousel} 1
:class-carousel: custom-carousel

```{card}
:class-card: carousel-card
![image1](../assets/slides/1.jpg)
